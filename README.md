# 100 Days of Code

This Git repository was created to host all the different projects created by me while taking part in the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

For now, I will be updating this readme file as and when I create a new project.

## Day One

### Band Name Generator

This project will deal with the concepts of printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.

The script accepts the name of the city you grew up in, the name of your pet and suggests a band name by combining your city name and your pet name.

## Day Two

### Tip Calculator

This project will deal with the concepts of data types, operations, type conversion and f-strings.

The script accepts a total bill amount, number of people the bill must be split among, and a tip percentage. It then outputs the share that each person has to pay.

## Day Three

### Treasure Island

This project will deal with the concepts of conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, and scope of a variable (local and global).

In this project, users play a text-based game called 'Treasure Island' where the objective is to navigate based on the instructions that appear on screen and find a hidden treasure.

## Day Four

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project will deal with the concepts of randomisation and lists.

The script will recreate the classic kids game rock, paper, scissors.

## Day Five

### Password Generator

This project will deal with the concepts of for loops, range, and code blocks.

The script will ask users how many letters, symbols and numbers they want in their password and then generate a random password tailored to their specifications.

## Day Six

### Escape the Maze

This project will deal with the concepts of while loops and functions.

In this project, we will make use of the website [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html) which allows users to learn Python concepts by moving around a robot called Reeborg.

This project will specifically deal with the [Lost in a Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) challenge where you have to help Reeborg escape the maze. Reeborg's position is generated randomly each time the script is run, making the challenge quite interesting.

## Day Seven

### Hangman

This project further strengthens the concepts covered in the previous and deals with breaking down a big problem statements into smaller problems that can be tackled easily. This project also introduces small checks to the UI such as validation messages and ASCII art to help the user understand the game better and make the experience more enjoyable.

In this project, we will recreate the classic game - 'Hangman'. The objective of this game is to guess a secret word, one letter at a time. Every wrong guess loses the user a life and the user must guess the word before they run out of lives.

## Day Eight

### Caeser Cipher

This project deals with the concept of passing arguments to functions.

In this project, we will write a Python script that encodes and decodes strings using the Caesar Cipher.

The Caeser Cipher is an ancient encryption method where plaintext letters were replaced with another alphabet shifted some number down the alphabet. The number of shifts is previously agreed upon between the sender and recipient. For example, the world 'Hello' with a shift of 3 becomes 'Khoor'.

The script goes one step further to also shift the digits of a number in the same cyclic manner that happens with the alphabet.

## Day Nine

### Silent Auction

This project deals with the concept of Python dictionaries and nesting.

In this project we will build a silent auction program where multiple users can bid silently, i.e, without revealing their bid amount and the highest bidder is picked as the winner.

## Day Ten

### Calculator

This project deals with the concept of creating functions that return outputs.

This project is a text-based calculator app where the users are first asked to enter a number, pick an operation, and enter the other number. It then shows the user the computation and asks
if the user wants to continue calculating using the same number, or move on to a different calculation.

## Day Eleven

### Blackjack

This is a capstone project that will cover all the different topics dealt with so far.

In this project, we will attempt to recreate the classic game of Blackjack.

## Day Twelve

### Number Guessing Game

This project will deal with the concepts of global and local variable scope in python.

In this project, we will create a number guessing game wherein the user has to guess a randomly generated number by the computer.
Each time the user guesses a number, a prompt will show them if their guess is too high or too low.
The game also comes with two difficulties, 'easy' and 'hard'. Easy mode gives the users 10 attempts to guess the right word whereas 'hard' difficulty gives the user only 5 attempts.
