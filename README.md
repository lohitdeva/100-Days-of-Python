# 100 Days of Code

This Git repository was created to host all the different projects created by me while taking part in the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

For now, I will be updating this readme file as and when I create a new project.

## Day One

### Band Name Generator

This project will deal with the concepts of printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.

The script accepts the name of the city you grew up in, the name of your pet and suggests a band name by combining your city name and your pet name.

## Day Two

### Tip Calculator

This project will deal with the concepts of data types, operations, type conversion and f-strings.

The script accepts a total bill amount, number of people the bill must be split among, and a tip percentage. It then outputs the share that each person has to pay.
