# 100 Days of Code

This Git repository was created to host all the different projects created by me while taking part in the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

For now, I will be updating this readme file as and when I create a new project.

## Day One

### Band Name Generator

This project will deal with the concepts of printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation and variables.

The script accepts the name of the city you grew up in, the name of your pet and suggests a band name by combining your city name and your pet name.
